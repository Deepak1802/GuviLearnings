1.HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol
2.Its a application protocol used for the standard communication on the world wide web since its invention in 1989
3.From the release of HTTP/1.1 in 1997 until recently, there have been few revisions to the protocol.
4.But in 2015, a reimagined version called HTTP/2 came into use, which offered several methods to decrease latency, 
    especially when dealing with mobile platforms and server-intensive graphics and videos
HTTP 1.1 
    * Developed by Timothy Berners-Lee in 1989 as a communication standard for the World Wide Web
    * HTTP is a top-level application protocol that exchanges information between a client computer and a local or remote web server
    * In this process, a client sends a text-based request to a server by calling a method like GET or POST. In response, 
        the server sends a resource like an HTML page back to the client
    * For example, letâ€™s say you are visiting a website at the domain www.example.com. When you navigate to this URL, 
        the web browser on your computer sends an HTTP request in the form of a text-based message, similar to the one shown here:
            Example:
            GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
            Host: www.example.com
    * This request uses the GET method, which asks for data from the host server listed after Host:. 
        In response to this request, the example.com web server returns an HTML page to the requesting client, 
        in addition to any images, stylesheets, or other resources called for in the HTML.
    * Note that not all of the resources are returned to the client in the first call for data. 
        The requests and responses will go back and forth between the server and client until the web browser has 
        received all the resources necessary to render the contents of the HTML page on your screen.
    * You can think of this exchange of requests and responses as a single application layer of the internet protocol stack, 
        sitting on top of the transfer layer (usually using the Transmission Control Protocol, or TCP) 
        and networking layers (using the Internet Protocol, or IP):
    * HOST BROWSER --> APPLICATION LAYER (HTTP) --> TRANSPORT LAYER (TCP) --> NETWORK LAYER (IP) --> DATA LINK LAYER --> 
        INTERNET --> DATA LINK LAYER --> NETWORK LAYER (IP) --> TRANSPORT LAYER (TCP) --> APPLICATION LAYER --> TARGET (WEB SERVER)
    *
