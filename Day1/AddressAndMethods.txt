    * It is a address of process in given computer or node or host
    * Every process in a computer has unique port number
    * Port number is assigned at transport layer with given segment
    * Port is also referred communication end point
    * Fixed and Dynamic port numbers have range as per (0 - 65535)
* IP Address :
    * IP is a internet protocol
    * Every node in the computer network is identified with the IP address only.
    * They are two type IPV4 and IPV6.
    * IP adress is used for logical addressing
    * IP address is added with segment to form packets at network layer
    * IP address is based on the location of device and it can be changed manually
    * Range of IPV4 is 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255 means 32 bits
* MAC Address:
    * MAC is Media Access Control
    * Every Node in the LAN is identified with the help of MAC Address
    * It given physical address of the device
    * IP Gives locaion of node while MAC is name of the node in given LAN
    * MAC is 12 digits Hex Code with 48 bits
    * MAC is unique for given node assigned by manufacturer of computer / Router
    * Example of my computer with
        * Wifi - 18 : 47 : 3D : D7 : C8 : 73
    * Seperator Can be (-), (.), (:)
    * MAC Address is added with packet to form frame
*HTTP Methods:

    * CONNECT
        * The CONNECT method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.
    * OPTIONS
